<h2>PONGSNAKE INVADERS</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
My game combines 3 very well known games into one new and
interesting product, which ends up being a lot more
difficult than any of the originals in my opinion.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
My game has, in a way, three separate games going at once but
interacting with each other. It was difficult to get the code
somewhat clean and making sense.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

I really strengthened my javascript skills but it was hard 
because I had to learn a lot of new things in a short amount 
of time which meant there were a lot of mistakes.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Spaceship:<a href="https://opengameart.org/content/2d-spaceship-sprites-with-engines">2d Spaceship Sprites With Engines by morgan3d</a></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

I didn't borrow any code but my game obviously draws on Pong, Snake, and Space Invaders.
</li>



<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
The player plays a game of snake while interacting with Pong and Space Invaders.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.

Not really any theme because there is no story.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.

Keyboard input, randomness in the placement of the apple and the movement of the spaceship.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?

This prototype is evaluating player movement, sound effects, and understanding of Javascript.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?

I want people to feel pressured because there's so much they have to avoid.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.

The player uses the arrow keys to move their snake around and collect the red "apples". Eating an apple places a new apple and extends the player's tail. If the player eats their tail or collides with the pong paddles or ball or the space invaders bullet, the player dies and loses the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Not dying.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?

It's abstract and very simple. There really isn't any setting or anything.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
People who are into retro games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
It goes indefinitely until the player dies.
</li>
