<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I think it's interesting that there's several ways to win so there can be different strategies
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It uses a sense of gravity almost (to get the gold to go one way or another) which is interesting
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about using physics in phaser and balancing numbers
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made my visuals on Pixilart and I used sounds from freesound.org
<ul>
<li>Pixilart: <a href="Pixilart.com">Pixilart.com</a></li>
<li>Coin Sound: <a href = "freesound.org/people/bradwesson/sounds/135936">CollectCoin.wav</a></li>
<li>Shoot Sound: <a href = "freesound.org/people/MATTIX/sounds/459145">Retro_Pew_Shot.wav</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I started with a concept that was like tug of war but with guns so I guess it's something like that, but I ended up making a decent number of changes between the idea and finishing the game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A fast paced strategic tug of war combined with a shooting game
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I don't really have a storymatic theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
There isn't really any randomness in the game, but it takes user input etc.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Multiplayer game
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want it to feel fast paced and exciting.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player 1 (Purple) uses WAD to go Up, Left, Right, and S to shoot. Player 2 (Green) uses IJL to go Up, Left, Right and K to shoot. Shooting the enemy makes them unable to shoot for some time and gains you one point. Shooting the enemy solid block attracts the gold coin to your own block. If the coin hits your block, it resets and you gain 50 points. The first player to 200 points wins.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I think strategies will diverge based on what the enemy is doing because there are several ways to win.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
There are no characters or story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The people in this class
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Only a few minutes per round.
</li>

</ul>
