<h2>Bakery Idle v0.1</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Having different categories for units to buy gives a lot more choice to the player than in many idle games, where you're just going from one tier to another tier to another.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I use a large number of buttons and sprites to make the tabs and button system work properly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The hardest part was probably balancing all the numbers, which didnt end up too well. There are so many numbers to balance and it made it really difficult to create a good balance of difficulty.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made most of my assets from scratch. The one exception is the purple background, which my girlfriend made (Thanks Anna).

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It's similar to a lot of other idle games like Cookie Clicker and others.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A bakery-themed idle game with lots of different categories of buyable units with unique feels.
</li>



<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

</ul>
